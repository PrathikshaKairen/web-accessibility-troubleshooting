      <h2>The trouble with Bears</h2>
      <p>By Evan Wild</p>
      <p>Tall, lumbering, angry, dangerous. The real live bears of this world are proud, independent creatures, self-serving and always on the hunt for food. Nothing like the bears you see on TV, like Baloo from renowned documentary, The Jungle Book.</p>
      
      <h3>Types of bear</h3>
      <p>Bears come in two varieties — large and medium. You don't get small bears. If you have seen a small bear, then it was in fact probably a baby bear (cub) from another species.</p>
      
      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th scope="col">Bear Type</th>
            <th scope="col">Coat</th>

        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>Wild</td>
            <td>Brown or black</td>
            <td>1.4 to 2.8 meters</td>
            <td>Woods and forests</td>
            <td>25 to 28 years</td>
            <td>Fish, meat, plants</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Urban</td>
            <td>North Face</td>
            <td>18 to 22</td>
            <td>Condos and coffee shops</td>
            <td>20 to 32 years</td>
            <td>Starbucks, sushi</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <h3>Habitats and Eating habits</h3>
      <p>Wild bears eat a variety of meat, fish, fruit, nuts, and other natually growing ingredients. In general they will hunt for food themselves in woodland or rivers, but at a push they will track down their sustenance from farms or country houses. They tend to live in relative isolation, in caves, tents, or cottages.</p>

      <p>Urban (gentrified) bears on the other hand have largely abandoned the old ways...</p>
      <img src="media/urban-bear.jpg" alt="Urban bear scavenging in a city alley">
      
      <p>Urban bears will sleep anywhere they can, from bus shelters and parks, to the toilets in McDonalds, to their own apartment.</p>
      
      <h3>Mating rituals</h3>
      <p>Bears are romantic creatures by nature, and will naturally look for a mate that they can spend the rest of their lives with. They will woo a potential suitor by making their dwelling look attractive — for example with cave paintings or a bed of reeds in the case of a wild bear, and mood lighting and a Michael Bublé CD in the case of an urban bear.</p>
